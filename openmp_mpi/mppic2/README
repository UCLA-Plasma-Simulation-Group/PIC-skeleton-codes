This program contains sample codes for illustrating the basic structure
of a 2D Electrostatic MPI/OpenMP Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code, in both
Fortran and C.  The codes have no diagnosics except for initial and
final energies.  Their primary purpose is to provide example codes for
physical science students learning about MPI/OpenMP PIC codes.  They are
also intended as benchmark reference codes to aid in developing new
codes and in evaluating new computer architectures.  Parallel versions
of this code with the same structure for MPI only (ppic2) and OpenMP
only (mpic2) also exist, and can be compared to this code in order to
understand the parallel algorithms.

PIC codes are widely used in plasma physics.  They model plasmas as
particles which interact self-consistently via the electromagnetic
fields they themselves produce.  PIC codes generally have three
important procedures in the main iteration loop.  The first is the
deposit, where some particle quantity, such as a charge, is accumulated
on a grid via interpolation to produce a source density.  The second
important procedure is the field solver, which solves Maxwell’s equation
or a subset to obtain the electric and/or magnetic fields from the
source densities.  Finally, once the fields are obtained, the particle
forces are found by interpolation from the grid, and the particle
co-ordinates are updated, using Newton’s second law and the Lorentz
force.  The particle processing parts dominate over the field solving
parts in a typical PIC application.

The code here uses the simplest force, the electrostatic Coulomb
interaction, obtained by solving a Poisson equation.  A spectral method
using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) is used to solve the Poisson
equation.  A real to complex FFT is used, and the data in Fourier space
is stored in a packed format, where the input and output sizes are the
same.  The boundary conditions are periodic, only electron species are
included, and linear interpolation is used.

For parallelization, the code uses two levels of parallelism.  The
outermost level uses a simple domain decomposition scheme, where the
field quantities (electric field, charge density) are divided among the
computational nodes.  The primary decomposition divides the y values
evenly, that is, each MPI node has all the x values for some y.  The
particles are distributed so that the y co-ordinates of the particles
have a value within the domain.  This simple decomposition works if the
particles are uniformly distributed in space.  Particles at the edge of
the domain may need information from the next domain in order to
interpolate the fields.  To avoid unnecessary communication, one extra
guard cell in y is added at the end of each domain that replicates the
first y value in the next domain.  After particles are updated, some
particles may move to a neighboring domain.  A particle manager
(PPPMOVE2) is responsible for moving such particles to the appropriate
domain.  The FFT is performed in 3 steps.  In going from real space to
Fourier space, the FFT is first performed in x for the y values in the
primary domain.  The data is then transposed to a secondary domain
decomposition, where each node has all the y values for some x.  The FFT
is then performed in the y direction for the x values in the secondary
domain.  Poisson's equation is solved using this secondary decomposition
There are four main communication procedures which use MPI.  The first
adds the guard cells for the charge density, the second copies the guard
cells for the electric field.  The third is the particle manager, and
the fourth transposes the data between primary and secondary
decompositions using an all to all communication pattern.  Further
information about the domain decomposition parallel algorithms used can
be found in the companion presentation Dcomp.pdf and in the article:
p. c. liewer and v. k. decyk, j. computational phys. 85, 302 (1989).

On each MPI node, a second level of parallelism is used.  The innermost
level uses a tiling (or blocking) technique. Space is divided into small
2D tiles (with typically 16x16 grid points in a tile), and particles are
organized so that their co-ordinates in x and y lie within the same tile
and are stored together in memory.  Assigning different threads to
different tiles avoids data collisions (where 2 threads try to write to
the same memory location at the same time).  The size of the tiles
should be smaller than the L1 cache and the number of tiles should be
equal to or greater than the number of processing cores.  There are 3
major procedures which make use of the tiled data structure, the charge
deposit, the particle push, and the particle reordering.  In the deposit
procedure, each thread first deposits to a small local density array the
size of a tile plus guard cells.  After all the particles in a tile have
been processed the small density array is added to the global charge
density array.  The particle push is similar, where each thread first
copies the global field array to a small local field array which is then
used for field interpolation.  The particle reordering step is divided
into two procedures.  The first procedure (PPORDERF2LA) moves particles
which are leaving a tile into an ordered particle buffer.  In addition,
those particles which are leaving the MPI node are copied to an MPI send
buffer.  The MPI particle manager (PPPMOVE2) then sends and receives the
particle buffer.  The second procedure (PPORDERF2LB) then copies the
incoming particles, either from the ordered particle buffer or from the
MPI receive buffer, and inserts the particles into the appropriate
location in the particle array.  Further information about this tiling
parallel algorithm used can be found in the article: V. K. Decyk and
T. V. Singh, "Particle-in-Cell Algorithms for Emerging Computer
Architectures," Computer Physics Communications, 185, 708, 2014,
available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2013.10.013.  Further
information about the hybrid domain decomposition/tiling scheme can be
found in the companion presentation MPI-OpenMP-PIC.pdf.

The default particle push calculates the list of particles leaving the
tiles.  This was done because the code was faster.  There is, however, a
version of the push (PPGPPUSH2L) which does not calculate the list, and
is easier to understand.  This version of the push requires a different
reordering procedure (PPPORDER2LA) which calculates the list.

Important differences between the push and deposit procedures (in
mppush2.f and mppush2.c) and the OpenMP versions (in mpush2.f and
mpush2.c in the mpic2 directory) are highlighted in the files
dmppush2_f.pdf and dmppush2_c.pdf, respectively.

Differences between the main codes (mppic2.f90 and mppic2.c) and the
main codes in the MPI versions in the ppic2 directory (ppic2.f90 and
ppic2.c) are highlighted in the files dmppic2_f90.pdf and dmppic2_c.pdf,
respectively. 

Particles are initialized with a uniform distribution in space and a 
gaussian distribution in velocity space.  This describes a plasma in
thermal equilibrium.  The inner loop contains a charge deposit, add
guard cell procedures, a scalar FFT, a Poisson solver, a vector FFT,
copy guard cell procedures, a particle push, a particle manager, and a
particle sorting procedure.  The final energy and timings are printed.
A sample output file for the default input parameters is included in the
file output.

In more detail, the inner loop of the code contains the following
procedures in Fortran (C):

Deposit section:
   PPGPPOST2L (cppgppost2l): deposit charge density
   PPAGUARD2XL (cppaguard2xl): add charge density guard cells in x on
                               local processor

   PPORDERF2LA (cpporderf2la): copies outgoing particles to buffers from
                               list supplied by PPGPPUSHF2L.

The inputs to the code are the grid parameters indx, indy, the particle
number parameters npx, npy, the time parameters tend, dt, and the
velocity paramters vtx, vty, vx0, vy0.  In addition, a tile size mx, my,
and overflow size xtras are defined.

In more detail:
indx = exponent which determines length in x direction, nx=2**indx.
indy = exponent which determines length in y direction, ny=2**indy.
   These ensure the system lengths are a power of 2.
npx = number of electrons distributed in x direction.
npy = number of electrons distributed in y direction.
   The total number of particles in the simulation is npx*npy.
tend = time at end of simulation, in units of plasma frequency.
dt = time interval between successive calculations.
   The number of time steps the code runs is given by tend/dt.
   dt should be less than .2 for the electrostatic code.
vtx/vty = thermal velocity of electrons in x/y direction
   a typical value is 1.0.
vx0/vy0 = drift velocity of electrons in x/y direction.
mx/my = number of grids points in x and y in each tile
   should be less than or equal to 32.

The makefile is setup to use gcc and gfortran with Linux.  A version for
Mac OS X is also in the Makefile, but is commented out.  

Two executables can be created, fmppic2 for Fortran, and cmppic2 for C.

To compile program, execute:

Make program_name

where program_name is either: fmppic2 or cmppic2, or execute:

make

to create both programs.

The command to execute a program with both MPI and OpenMP varies from
one system to another.  One possible command is:

mpiexec -np nproc -perhost n ./program_name

where program_name is either fmppic2 or cmppic2, and
where nproc is the number of processors to be used, and
where n is the number of MPI nodes per host.

There is one restriction on the number of processors which can be used:
this simple skeleton code does not support the case where MPI nodes have
zero grid points.  This special case can happen for certain combinations
of the grid size in y (set by the parameter indy) and the number of
processors chosen.  If this happens the code will exit with an error
message.  This special case will never occur if the grid size in y is an
exact multiple of the number of processors.

By default, OpenMP will use the maximum number of processors it can find
on the MPI node.  If the user wants to control the number of threads, a
parameter nvpp can be set in the main program.  In addition, the
environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS may need to be set to the maximum
number of threads per node expected.

The file output contains the results produced for the default parameters.
Typical timing results are shown in the file fmppic2_bench.pdf.

The Fortran version can be compiled to run with double precision by
changing the Makefile (typically by setting the compiler options flags
-r8).

The libraries pplib2.c, omplib.c, and mppush2.c contain wrapper
functions to allow the C libraries to be called from Fortran.  The
libraries pplib2_f.c, omplib_f.c, and mppush2_f.c contain wrapper
functions to allow the Fortran libraries to be called from C.
