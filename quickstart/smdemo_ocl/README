This program contains sample codes for illustrating how to set up and
run a simple parallel test code, using OpenCL with both C and Fortran.
The test case is simple vector add function. These codes can be used as
templates for setting up more complex programs.

For OpenCL, two executables can be created:
cgputest_cl, creates a C main program from a C library gpulib_cl.c
fgputest_cl, creates a Fortran main program from a C library gpulib_cl.c
The C library gpulib_cl.c is compiled using the gcc compiler.
The main program fgputest_cl.f90 is compiled using gfortran.

To compile and link each individual program, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either:
fgputest_cl, cgputest_cl

To compile both programs, execute:

make

The makefile is setup to use gcc, gfortran with Linux.  A version for
Mac OS X is also in the Makefile, but is commented out.  (To run on
MacOS the program gpulib_cl.c also needs to be changed to use the
header file OpenCL/opencl.h instead of CL/cl.h)

To execute either program, type the name of the executable:

./program_name
