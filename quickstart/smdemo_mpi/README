This program contains sample codes for illustrating how to set up and
and run a simple parallel test code, using MPI with both C and Fortran.
The test case is simple vector add function. These codes can be used as 
templates for setting up more complex programs.

For MPI, two executables can be created:
cmpitest, creates a C main program from a C library mpilib.c
fmpitest, creates a Fortran main program from a Fortran library mpilib.f
The C library mpilib.c is compiled using the mpicc compiler.
The Fortran library mpilib.f is compiled using the mpif90 compiler.

To compile and link each individual program, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either:
fmpitest or cmpitest

To compile both programs, execute:

make

or

make mpi

The makefile is setup to use mpicc and mpif90 with Linux.  A version for
Mac OS X is also in the Makefile, but is commented out.

To execute an MPI program, type:

mpirun -np NUMPROCS ./program_name

where NUMPROCS is the desired number of nodes to use.
