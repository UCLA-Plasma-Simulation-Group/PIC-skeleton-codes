This program contains a sample code for illustrating how to set up
and run a simple parallel test code, using CUDA Fortran.  The test case
is simple vector add function. These codes can be used as templates
for setting up more complex programs.

For CUDA Fortran, one executable can be created:
fgputest_cuf, creates a Fortran main program from a Fortran library
gpumain_cuf.cuf.  The Fortran library gpulib_cuf.cuf is compiled using
the PGI pgf90 CUDA compiler.  The main program fgputest_cuf.f90 is
compiled using the PGI pgf90 CUDA compiler.

To compile and link the CUDA Fortran program, execute:

make fgputest_cuf

To execute, type:

./fgputest_cuf
