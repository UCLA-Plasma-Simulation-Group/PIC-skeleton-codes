This directory contains procedures that are useful for performing wave
diagnostics, such as measuring the wavenumber and frequency of plasma
waves, for the 2-1/2D Darwin MPI Particle-in-Cell (PIC) codes in the
pdpic2 directory.  The procedures, written in Fortran, are in the file
pdfield2.f.  The file pdfield2_f.c contains wrapper functions to allow
the Fortran procedures to be called from C.

The electric and magnetic fields used to advance particles are smoothed
by suppressing large wavenumbers in order to avoid numerical errors due
to aliasing.  The field diagnostics, however, are normally unsmoothed.
The main diagnostics are the electrostatic potential and the vector
potential in fourier space, in the Coulomb gauge.  These are calculated
by the procedures PPOTP2 and PPAPOTP23, respectively.  Other
diagnostics, such as the unsmoothed longitudinal electric field and
magnetic field can be calculated from the potentials with the procedures
PPGRADF2 and PPCURLF2, respectively.  The procedure PPEPOISP23 can be
called with isign=1 to obtain the unsmoothed transverse electric field.
The fourier modes are normally stored to disk for later post-processing,
such as by performing a fourier transform in time to obtain the
frequencies for different wavenumbers.  It is usually not necessary to
store all the modes to disk, since the high wavenumber modes are usually
unimportant.  Furthermore, the fourier modes are stored in a packed
format which is difficult to work with.  Thus procedures PPRDMODES2 and
PPRDVMODES2 are also provided to extract a subset of the fourier modes
for the potential and vector fields respectively, and copy them in an
unpacked format for easier post-processing. (The procedures PPWRMODES2
and PPWRVMODES2 are provided to repack the scalar or vector fourier
modes, if needed.)

To use these procedures, one first needs to add some declarations in the
main programs pdpic2.90 and pdpic2.c in the parent directory pdpic2,
similar to the following.

For Fortran:
   integer :: modesx, modesy, modesxpd, modesyd
   complex, dimension(:,:), pointer :: potc, pott
   complex, dimension(:,:,:), pointer :: vpotc, vpott

For C:
   int modesx, modesy, modesxpd, modesyd;
   float complex *potc = NULL, *pott = NULL;
   float complex *vpotc = NULL, *vpott = NULL;
   
Then before the main iteration loop, one needs to allocate the arrays.

For Fortran:
   modesx = nx/4; modesy = ny/4
   modesxpd = min(modesx,kxp); modesyd = min(2*modesy-1,ny)
   if (modesx==(nx/2+1)) modesxpd = modesxpd + 1
   allocate(potc(nye,kxp),vpotc(ndim,nye,kxp))
   allocate(pott(modesyd,modesxpd))
   allocate(vpott(ndim,modesyd,modesxpd))

For C:
   modesx = nx/4; modesy = ny/4;
   modesxd = modesx; modesyd = 2*modesy - 1;
   modesyd = modesyd < ny ? modesyd : ny;
   if (modesx==(nx/2+1))
      modesxpd += 1;
   potc = (float complex *) malloc(nye*kxp*sizeof(float complex));
   vpotc = (float complex *) malloc(ndim*nye*kxp*sizeof(float complex));
   pott = (float complex *) malloc(modesyd*modesxpd*sizeof(float complex));
   vpott = (float complex *) malloc(ndim*modesyd*modesxpd*sizeof(float complex));

Finally, in the main iteration loops just before the push procedures,
one can add some diagnostics, such as:

For Fortran:
! perform potential diagnostic and unpack into array pott
! updates potc, pott, wt
   call PPOTP2(qt,potc,ffc,wt,nx,ny,kstrt,nye,kxp,nyh)
   call PPRDMODES2(potc,pott,nx,ny,modesx,modesy,kstrt,nye,kxp,modesxpd,
                   modesyd)
! perform vector potential diagnostic and unpack into array vpott
! updates vpotc, vpott, wt
   call PPAPOTP23(cut,vpotc,ffc,ci,wt,nx,ny,kstrt,nye,kxp,nyh)
   call PPRDVMODES2(vpotc,vpott,nx,ny,modesx,modesy,ndim,kstrt,nye,kxp,
                    modesxpd,modesyd)

For C:
/* perform potential diagnostic and unpack into array pott */
/* updates potc, pott, wt                                  */
   cppotp2(qt,potc,ffc,&wt,nx,ny,kstrt,nye,kxp,nyh);
   cpprdmodes2(potc,pott,nx,ny,modesx,modesy,kstrt,nye,kxp,modesxpd,
               modesyd);
/* perform vector potential diagnostic and unpack into array vpott */
/* updates vpotc, vpott, wt                                        */
   cppapotp23(cut,vpotc,ffc,ci,&wt,nx,ny,kstrt,nye,kxp,nyh);
   cpprdvmodes2(vpotc,vpott,nx,ny,modesx,modesy,ndim,kstrt,nye,kxp,
                modesxpd,modesyd);

One would have to modify the Makefile as well to include the files
pdfield2.f and pdfield2_f.c, as needed.
