This program contains sample codes for illustrating how to set up
and run a simple parallel test code, using Intel's SSE with both C and
Fortran.  The test case is a simple vector add function. These codes can
be used as templates for setting up more complex programs.

For SSE, two executables can be created:
cssetest, creates a C main program from a C library sselib.c
fssetest, creates a Fortran main program from a C library sselib.c
The C library sselib.c is compiled using the gcc compiler.

To compile and link each individual program, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either:
cssetest or fssetest

To compile both programs, execute:

make

The makefile is setup to use gcc, gfortran with Linux.  A version for
Mac OS X is also in the Makefile, but is commented out.

To execute either program, type the name of the executable:

./program_name
